# FixedNav - Sticky your navbar today!

Stickies OctoPrint's navbar to the top of the browser window so when you scroll down, the navbar will always* be visible.

*Doesn't do so much when using a mobile browser such as Chrome on Android as that seems to make the entire browser scroll (seems to scroll the screen, rather than the contents of the browser window as even the browser's own toolbar vanishes into the ether.)

## Setup

Install ~~via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)~~
or manually using this URL:
